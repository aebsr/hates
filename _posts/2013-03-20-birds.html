<p>Put simply, I don&rsquo;t trust them. I can feel them peering into my soul waiting for the right opportunity to strike and put their filthy little beaks through my retina.</p>

<p>It all started in 2nd grade. City pigeons are notorious for being the fat lazy bastards of the bird world, but D.C. it gets even worst. These indifferent peices of shit would crowd the walk way in front of my apartment building with their wingless cousins, the squirrel. No ammount of shouting, stomping or walking would cause them to scatter. I had no choice but to sheild my eyes and break a run for it. Every day before school, I had to do this.</p>

<p>Maybe I&rsquo;m traumatized. Or maybe, I just see them for <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPC_Mp0Y9WM">what they are</a>. Inconsiderate creatures that poop on your car, dive bomb you from a far and can <a href="http://news.discovery.com/animals/zoo-animals/angry-crows-memory-life-threatening-behavior-110628.htm>REMEMBER YOUR FACE</a>. Just today, I watched a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=ADrXwFsQe6A#t=61s">Blue Jay</a> repeatidly dive bomb and pick at a friends parked car.</p>

<p>Bastards.</p>
