<p>Nerds are socially awkard, and give geeks a bad name.</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>&ldquo;Being a geek is all about being honest about what you enjoy and not being afraid to demonstrate that affection. It means never having to play it cool about how much you like something. It&rsquo;s basically a license to proudly emote on a somewhat childish level rather than behave like a supposed adult. Being a geek is extremely liberating.&rdquo;</p>
