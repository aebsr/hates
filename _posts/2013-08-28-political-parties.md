Because you know, who doesn't.

But in the name of verbosity... Everyone has it wrong. I generally believe that aligning yourself with any political conglomerate is lazy and sheepish. If you agree with every point of argument for a specific group then you obviously aren't thinking for yourself, but rather compromising on whatever is important to you for sake of something else slightly more important. Offended yet?

## Closet Republican
The wealthiest guy I know just said I was a closet republican. This is something even my wife has accused me of. While I don't identify as that or a Democrat I take special offense to this notion. And so to air it out, here's my political stance on key party [issues](http://www.ontheissues.org/default.htm#Analysis). I won't go into too much detail because laws, should be black and white and I refuse to debate grey areas.

**Abortion:** It's simple, choice. With a cap on when it can be done based on whatever people smarter than I decide is too late. _Stance - blue_.

**Same Sex Marriage:** Leave people alone. Let them be happy or miserable on their own terms, assuming everyone is being safe and respectful. _Stance - red_.

**Death Penalty:** It's complex, but the short answer is... flick the switch. We need however clearer guidelines and requirements to be met before one can be sentenced to death. Until we can remove the systematic black is to death as white is to life sentencing she should however have a general stay of executions across the board. _Stance - purple_

**Healthcare:** Basic health care isn't a human right, but it should be an American one. But rather than focusing on who's paying for it, we need to focus on why it's so damn expensive. _Stance - purple, I think_

**Social Security:** If you've contributed to society in a meaningful way for a certain period of time, the basic necessities for live should be provided. Nothing more. Some personal responsibility is required to fund anything more. _Stance - purple, I think_

**Energy/Fuel:** Get the fuck off oil. We're better than that, and it's time to start acting like it. A nation wide shift to renewable energy is an infrastructural endeavor so any government resources or funding needed to make it happen, should be made available. And policed, because you know corporations are people now, and people are greedy. _Stance - greenish blue_

**Marijuana:** Uhmm, puff puff pass my man. We could use the revenue and the prison industrial complex doesn't need any more residents. _Stance - blue_

**Taxes:** Consumption tax for the win. Don't tell me stiff sales tax will cause people to not buy things. We're human, and worse than that, we're American. We will buy what we want, and because of that should be taxed fairly. The rich guy who buys his 10th home or the crazy expensive sports car should be taxed at the same rate as the poor guy who has no business buying the new iPhone 18s with a Terabyte of storage. Exceptions include the same things that are tax free today, such as produce and back to school shopping weeks. _stance - purple_

**Campaign Funding:** Lock that shit down like the plague. _stance - unknown_

**Patriot Act:** I'm torn. On one hand, give me freedom or give me death. On the other, I have nothing to hide. And if there was a chance we could ensure that access to all our personal information wouldn't be abused by some lonely hacker or government worker, go for it. This of course is only true if everyone is then treated equally. We can dream. _Stance - purple_

**2nd Amendment:** I own 3 guns. I have two more on my wish list. None are automatic rifles. Though I don't have the need for it, and don't really get others desires to own them I also get that any new restriction, begets another. The NRA is batshit more often than they are not, but they are also the only ones defending my right. So, the enemy of my enemy is my friend. And with that, I have to stand by their general stance of "from my cold dead hand". On the other warmer hand though, police, inspect and restrict who can own a firearm to your hearts content. I don't mind a long wait, or having to jump through hoops. Make it difficult, it should be. Very difficult in fact to own a firearm. And Uncle Sam, you should know who has a firearm. Because, they know you have plenty. Like with the Black Panthers, when you know we won't stand for bullshit you have to start rethinking the bullshit you're planning to pull. _Stance - red_

**Immigration:** If you're here illegally, get out. Want to get here, get in line. Make the laws and requirements the same across the board. No one gets special treatment. If you don't make the cut, sorry. Try next door. _Stance - red_

**Social Aide:** No child should go hungry. No person should be allowed to milk the system. We need better checks and balances and need to identify an "enough is enough" point. No amount of help, will make someone determined to live life as a leech think that being a worker bee is worth the time. _Stance - reddish purple_

**College:** Everyone should have potential access to free quality education. Voluntary Civil and Military service should provide every US Citizen to education. _Stance - blue, I think_
