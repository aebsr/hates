<p>I&rsquo;m not against animal conversation, but do agree that some animals are more worthy of our money, resources and time. You could argue that the Panda is no different than other species, that our world has evolved quicker than than it has. Though in reality, it&rsquo;s inability to adapt is due to genetic mutations.</p>
<p>An animal that eats primarily bamboo and can&rsquo;t obtain enough calories to work itself beyond a <a href="http://facts.randomhistory.com/giant-panda-facts.html">clumsy trot</a>, is a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/09/science/09mama.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0">shitty mother</a>, is plagued with <a href="http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/story/2012/09/25/panda-cubs-death-shows-nature-is-in-charge/57838334/1">breeding issues</a> and <a href="http://www.afp.com/en/node/668958">no longer contributes</a> to a natural balance isn&rsquo;t worth the resources we pour into it.</p>
