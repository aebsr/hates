<p>If you shop at Walmart, don&rsquo;t take this as a personal attack. As <a href="http://adage.com/article/adagestat/demographics-retail/233399/">research shows</a> that the Walmart demographic isn&rsquo;t much different from Target, where my family and I frequent. Sure I could cite <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-12-13/walmart-vs-dot-union-backed-our-walmart">other</a> <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,150846,00.html">reasons</a> <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/22/walmart-gender-discrimination_n_1905204.html">to</a> not like <a href="www.peopleofwalmart.com">Walmart</a> but in the end, I&rsquo;ll blame that very uneasy feeling I get whenever I walk through its&rsquo; doors. A gut feeling that says, get out now. Before it&rsquo;s too late.</p>
