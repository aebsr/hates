<p>These sum'a bitches made <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hater-app/id605500307">an app</a>?!</p>

<p>First off I hate things, people and places but I am by no means a "hater." After all haters are just people _"Having Anger Towards Everyone Reaching Success."_ And as you can tell, <a href="/the-panda-welfare-state/â€Ž">Pandas</a> aren't succeeding at anything.</p>
