<p>The scene...</p>

      Marcus: "Hey, how're you man?"<br />

<p>End scene.</p>

<p>It's nothing new. We all do it. Bullshit niceties when we pass colleagues, aquaintences and even strangers. "What's up?" is not the new "Hello."</p>

<p>I hate when one walks into a room to get something and says "What's up?" to the girl who's name they don't know well enough to say as they locate what they need and depart before she could give them an even remotely accurate or sincere approximation of what in fact is up with her.</p>

<p>I hate that as I wash my hands in the bathroom and a guy I know, but don't really know, says at the end of the day "Ready to get out of here?". What am I supposed to say, other than "Yes" or "No". Because I'm sure you don't want more detail than that. Maybe... "Actually no. This project is running long, and I'm way behind. But hey, it's no fault of anyone but myself. Gotta pay better attention to these damn deadlines. So yeah... I'm no way near ready, but maybe in another 3 hours. How about you?"</p>

<p>Wait, what's that? You kept walking after you entered the bathroom and proceeded to take a shit as I answered your question through the stall door. Sure you're here for a reason after all and that was to do exactly what you're doing. So how about next time, focus on that.</p>

<p>I'm not mad at all of you, just the ones skilled in delivering empty greetings. If you really want to know how I'm doing address me by name. It'll get my attention better and ensure I don't mistake your intention.</p>

<p>And to keep myself from <a href="http://www.littlethingsmatter.com/blog/2010/02/26/10-ways-to-make-a-positive-impression-when-greeting-people/">becoming</a> what I <a href="http://suite101.com/article/greetings-and-goodbyes-in-the-english-language-a404521">hate</a>, from now on I'll embrace the original empty greeting and salutation. "Hello" and "Goodbye". For extra credit I may even respond for you... "Hello. Hello." in a chipper tone means -- Don't say shit, just keep walking.</p>

<p>... and to lighten the mood, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_ILDFp5DGA">Hello</a>.</p>
