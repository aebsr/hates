<p>Vermont, Delaware, Conneticut, Rhode Island &amp; Maine <a href="http://www.dailyherald.com/article/20121105/discuss/711059952/">should</a> all be too small to matter, but some reason the residents of these places somehow think their small town, quaintness and ample amounts of untouched landscape (ok, that part is cool) makes them special. Massachusetts is cool though, it&rsquo;s like affirmative action for tiny states.</p>
